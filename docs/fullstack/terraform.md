## CDK for Terraform

Cloud Development Kit for Terraform (CDKTF) allows you to use familiar programming languages to define and provision infrastructure. This gives you access to the entire Terraform ecosystem **without learning HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL)** and lets you leverage the power of your existing toolchain for testing, dependency management, etc.

We support TypeScript, Python, Java, C#, and Go.
